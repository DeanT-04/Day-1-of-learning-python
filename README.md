# Day 1 of learning python
---
The project that I built today was a simple todo list which can add, remove and mark as complete. This project was a great first project as it used a lot syntaxes which gave me a foundation on what each variable represents.

- Array's
- def (defining a variable)
- if statement (true or false)
- while statement (runs until not true or false)
